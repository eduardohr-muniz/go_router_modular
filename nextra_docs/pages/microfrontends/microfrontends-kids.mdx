# 🏗️ EventModule for Microfrontends: How to Build a City of Apps!

Imagine you're going to build an **entire city** with different neighborhoods! 🏙️✨

## 🏘️ What are Microfrontends?

Think of microfrontends as **different neighborhoods** in your app-city:

- 🏪 **Shopping District** - where people buy things
- 🏥 **Health District** - where they take care of health  
- 🎮 **Games District** - where they have fun
- 🏦 **Banking District** - where they manage money
- 📚 **School District** - where they learn things

```
🏙️ MY APP-CITY:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🏪 Shopping     🏥 Health     🎮 Games  │
│     App            App         App        │
│                                         │
│  🏦 Banking      📚 School    📱 Chat    │
│     App            App         App        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 📞 The Problem: How Do Neighborhoods Talk?

Imagine if each neighborhood was an **isolated island**:

### 😰 Without EventModule (Sad Island):
```
🏪 Shopping Island     🏥 Health Island     🎮 Games Island
    "Help!"              "Hello? Hello?"       "Anyone there?"
       |                     |                    |
   💔 Alone              💔 Alone            💔 Alone
```

**Problems with Islands:**
- 🚫 **Don't talk** to each other
- 😵 **Total confusion** when they need to work together
- 🐌 **Very slow** to do team things
- 💸 **Waste** - each one does the same thing

### 🎉 With EventModule (Connected City):
```
🏪 Shopping ←→ 📞 CENTRAL ←→ 🏥 Health
               TELEPHONE
🎮 Games   ←→    MAGIC   ←→ 🏦 Banking
```

**Benefits of Connected City:**
- 📞 **Everyone talks** through the magic central
- ⚡ **Super fast** to coordinate
- 🤝 **Work as a team** perfectly
- 🎯 **Each one does their specialty**

## 🎭 How Does the Magic Work?

### 🛍️ Example: Buying a Game

Let's see how the city works when John wants to buy a game:

```
👦 John: "I want to buy Minecraft!"
   ↓
🏪 Shopping App: "Ok! Selling Minecraft for $30"
   ↓ 📢 (shouts to the whole city)
   💬 "PurchaseEvent: John bought Minecraft for $30!"
   ↓
📞 Central Telephone EventModule spreads the news:
   ↓                    ↓                    ↓
🏦 Banking App:      🎮 Games App:       📱 Chat App:
"Charging $30        "Unlocking         "John bought
 from John's account"  Minecraft"          a game!"
```

### 🎊 The Magic Result:

1. **🏪 Shopping**: "Sale completed! ✅"
2. **🏦 Banking**: "Money debited! 💳"  
3. **🎮 Games**: "Game unlocked! 🎮"
4. **📱 Chat**: "Friends know about the purchase! 💬"

**Everything happens automatically, like magic!** ✨

## 🎨 Creating Your Own City

### 🏗️ Step 1: Define the Neighborhoods

```dart
// 🏪 Shopping Neighborhood
class ShoppingModule extends EventModule {
  @override
  void listen() {
    on<WantToBuyEvent>((WantToBuyEvent event, BuildContext? context) {
      print('🛍️ ${event.person} wants to buy ${event.item}');
      // Process sale...
      ModularEvent.fire(PurchaseCompletedEvent(
        buyer: event.person,
        item: event.item,
        price: event.price,
      ));
    });
  }
}

// 🎮 Games Neighborhood  
class GamesModule extends EventModule {
  @override
  void listen() {
    on<PurchaseCompletedEvent>((PurchaseCompletedEvent event, BuildContext? context) {
      if (event.item.contains('Game')) {
        print('🎮 Unlocking game ${event.item} for ${event.buyer}');
        ModularEvent.fire(GameUnlockedEvent(
          player: event.buyer,
          game: event.item,
        ));
      }
    });
  }
}
```

### 🏗️ Step 2: Connect to Central

```dart

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp.router(
      title: '🏙️ My City App',
      routerConfig: GoRouterModular.routerConfig,
    );
  }
}

// 🏛️ City Hall (Main Module)
class CityModule extends Module {
  @override
  List<Module> get imports => [
    ShoppingModule(),    // 🏪 Shopping Neighborhood
    GamesModule(),       // 🎮 Games Neighborhood
    BankingModule(),     // 🏦 Banking Neighborhood

  @override
  List<ModularRoute> get routes => [
    ChildRoute('/', child: (context, state) => CityHomePage()),
  ];
}
```

### 🏗️ Step 3: Activate the Magic
